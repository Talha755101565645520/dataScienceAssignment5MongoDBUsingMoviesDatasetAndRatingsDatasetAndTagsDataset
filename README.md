# README to Know More About the MongoDB Movie Database Dataset Project

## Important Details:
I created a MongoDB Movie Database for storing records from a variety of movie datasets. I used Python to query the database, and the Pandas library for computing summary statistics over the data. The Python Code for this Movie Dataset Project was implemented
using Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda. This Movie Database applies an Aggregated Pipeline to make it uncomplicated to group the data, sort the data, do calculations on the data, and examine the data in detail.
